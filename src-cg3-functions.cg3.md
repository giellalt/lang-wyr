* Sets for POS sub-categories

* Sets for Semantic tags

* Sets for Morphosyntactic properties

* Sets for verbs

* NP sets defined according to their morphosyntactic features

* The PRE-NP-HEAD family of sets

These sets model noun phrases (NPs). The idea is to first define whatever can
occur in front of the head of the NP, and thereafter negate that with the
expression **WORD - premodifiers**.

* Miscellaneous sets

* Border sets and their complements

* Syntactic sets

These were the set types.
